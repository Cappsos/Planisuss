This is a unyversity group project where we built a simple agent base simulation with python.
All the stats of the simulation are plotted using matplotlib.

in the report file there is an extensive description of the code.

The 1000 days simulation folder should contain a set of saved variables that can be used for loading a world around the 1000 days, and the evolution of its properties.
